## Terminology

This project uses a couple of affixes to denote the type of files and their roles within the application:
- ****Entity**: A persistent storage entity, typically representing a table row in a database
- ****Dto**: A data transfer object, used for transferring data between layers
- ****Vm**: A view model, used for representing data in the UI

The build of the name will be as follows:
- **Entity**: `[Name]Entity`
- **Dto**: `[Name]Dto`
- **Vm**: `[Name]Vm`
